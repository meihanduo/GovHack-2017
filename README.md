# GovHack-2017 - The BEST (Best Estimate of Sydney Transport) Team
--------------------------------------------------

As you can see, the number of cars in Sydney is increasing over time. But how does this increase in traffic affect the overall speed of travel in Sydney? In 10 years time, how long will it take you to drive home to your family after a long day of work? To the department of transport, members of parliament in NSW and anyone who cares about the future of sydneyâ€™s transport infrastructure - we have produced a predictive model that will allow you to visualise the level of congestion in Sydney over time. With this, we can work together to build a better Sydney for Tomorrow.

The attached folders contain the following:

-Employment projections by travel zone

-Population projections by travel zone

-Rstudio code for trend growth predictions

-Tableau workbook packages containing traffic and congestion visualisations
